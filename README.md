## Advent of Code

Hi! This repository serves mainly for archiving my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

Don't use these solution as reference since they might not be optimal as my main goal is to learn new things and tweak around with concepts I'm not that familiar with. In fact, I apologize in advance for *overkilling* simple problems.

## Progress

### [**2023**](aoc-2023) - 12â˜… / 48â˜…

## Structure

There is a repository for each AoC Edition I've participated. Inside of it there will be a subfolder for each day and depending on the amount of languages I'm trying, another folder per language. ðŸ˜…

Ex.:

```
aoc
â”œâ”€â”€ aoc-<year>
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day-<n>
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ kotlin
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ part-1
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solve.kt
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test.txt
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ part-2
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ solve.kt
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ test.txt
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ python
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ part-1
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solve.py
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test.txt
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ part-2
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ solve.py
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ test.txt
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day-<n+1>
â”‚   |...
